                    CPP supports payments via direct bank debit bank accounts on

                    pre-registered debit cards are possible. However, before the
                    direct debit operation is allowed, the Cloudenly account
                    owners must have authorized their banks to allow the direct
                    debit from the registered bank account. Also, the account
                    owner must have profiled the registered account on NIBBS
                    Automated Payment System (NAPS) and or on Remita Automated
                    Payment System (RAPS). It is recommended that an account
                    owner profiles the intended bank account on both NAPS and
                    RAPS for redundancy purposes. It is important to note too
                    that where account owners intend to use multiple bank
                    accounts, individual accounts must be independently
                    authorized with their bankers as well as profiled on NAPS
                    and/or RAPS.

                    electronically. Each time that User uses the E-Sign Service,

                    Documents if User prefers. If the User would like to
                    manually sign a document, the User should (i) inform the

                    This Agreement, including all applicable Service Terms,
                    constitutes the entire agreement between Scelloo and User
                    regarding the Platform, Services, and Content and replaces
                    all prior understandings, communications, and agreements,
                    oral or written, regarding this subject matter. This
                    Agreement may be modified only by a written amendment signed
                    by the parties or as otherwise provided in Section 15 If any
                    part of this Agreement is deemed to be unenforceable or
                    invalid, that section will be removed without affecting the
                    remainder of the Agreement. The remaining terms will be
                    valid and enforceable. User may not assign this Agreement,
                    by operation of law or otherwise, without Scelloo’s prior
                    written consent. Any attempt by User to assign or transfer
                    this Agreement, without such consent, will be null. Scelloo
                    may freely assign or transfer this Agreement without
                    restriction. The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
                    the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties and their
                    respective successors and permitted assigns.

                    Any notices or other communications provided by Scelloo
                    under this Agreement, including those regarding
                    modifications to this Agreement, will be given: (i) via
                    email; or (ii) by posting to the Platform. For notices made
                    by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on
                    which such notice is given. For notices made by posting to
                    the Platform, the date of such posting will be deemed the
                    date that notice is given. Scelloo’s failure to enforce any
                    right or provision of this Agreement will not be considered
                    a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such
                    right or provision will be effective only if in writing and
                    signed by a duly authorized representative of Scelloo.
                    Except as expressly outlined in this Agreement, the exercise
                    by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement
