                    compromised systems or applying appropriate controls until

                    active database during the next clean-up that occurs once
                    every 3 months. The data deleted from the active database
                    will be deleted from backups after 3 months. When your paid

                    downgraded to a free account. In the event that your free

                    Data are stored in resilient servers, distributed via data

                    centre takes over and the operations are carried out
