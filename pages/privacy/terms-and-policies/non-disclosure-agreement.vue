                    notifies, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party in
                    writing of such demand for disclosure so that the Disclosing

                    confidentiality of the Confidential Information; provided in
                    the case of a broad regulatory request with respect to the
                    Receiving Party’s business (not targeted at Disclosing
                    Party), the Receiving Party may promptly comply with such
                    request provided the Receiving Party give the Disclosing
                    Party prompt notice of such disclosure. The Receiving Party
                    agrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate with
                    efforts by, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party
                    with respect to any such request for a protective order or
                    other relief. In any case where non-disclosure cannot be
                    avoided, the Receiving Party shall support the Disclosing
                    Party in limiting the extent of the disclosure to only the
                    necessary information required for that particular purpose
                    and not more. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
                    Disclosing Party is unable to obtain or does not seek a
                    protective order and the Receiving Party is legally

                    Information to be disclosed by the Disclosing Party pursuant
                    to the business relationship between them is of a unique and
                    valuable character, and that the unauthorized dissemination
                    of the Confidential Information would destroy or diminish
